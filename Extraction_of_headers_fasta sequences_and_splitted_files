## Extraction of the respective headers lists from the different multifasta files:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Specify the path to the directory containing the FASTA files
fasta_dir="$PATH/to/genome FASTA files"

# Loop through each FASTA file in the input directory
for fasta_file in "${fasta_dir}"*.fa; do
  # Create an output file name based on the input file name
  output_file="${fasta_file}.txt"

  # Extract protein IDs from the FASTA file
  grep -oE "^>(.+)" "${fasta_file}" | cut -d' ' -f1 | sed 's/^>//g' > "${output_file}"

  echo "Protein IDs extracted from ${fasta_file} and saved to ${output_file}."
done

```

## Extraction of multiple fasta sequences from a multiple headers text file:


First make an output_directory: 

I have made an output_directory inside the headers directory as extracted_sequences.  

```
#!/bin/bash

#Input files
fasta_file="filename of the multi-FASTA file from which sequences will be extracted"
output_dir="output_directory_name"

 #Loop through .txt files
for txt_file in *.txt; do
  # Create output file name
  output_file="${txt_file%.txt}_extracted.fasta"
  output_path="$output_dir/$output_file"

   #Loop through protein IDs in each .txt file
  while IFS= read -r protein_id; do
    # Execute seqtk subseq command for each protein ID
    seqtk subseq "$fasta_file" <(echo "$protein_id") >> "$output_path"
  done < "$txt_file"

  #Print status message
  echo "Sequences extracted from $txt_file and saved to $output_path"
done

```

*Inside the headers directory add all the individual headers.txt files and the concatenated multi-FASTA file (source file), so that the code can search for the headers in the source file and extract the fasta sequences.
