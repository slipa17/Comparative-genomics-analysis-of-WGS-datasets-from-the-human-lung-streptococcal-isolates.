# ABRICATE for antibiotic resistance 

* Installing Abricate using Conda

```
 conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults abricate
 
 abricate --check
 abricate --list
 ```
 * conda install: This is the command used to install packages with Conda.

* ```-c conda-forge```: This flag specifies the Conda channel from which the package will be installed. In this case, the "conda-forge" channel is specified, which is a community-driven channel that provides a wide range of software packages.

* ```-c bioconda```: This flag specifies an additional Conda channel, "bioconda", which is a channel specifically focused on bioinformatics packages.

* ```-c defaults```: This flag specifies the default Conda channel. It ensures that any dependencies required by the "abricate" package are also retrieved from the default channel.

* ```abricate```: This is the name of the package that you want to install using Conda. "abricate" is a bioinformatics tool used for analyzing genome assemblies and performing antibiotic resistance gene identification.

By executing the command conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults abricate, Conda will search for the "abricate" package in the specified channels (conda-forge, bioconda, and defaults) and install it along with any necessary dependencies.

Note: It's important to have Conda installed and set up properly on your system before running this command. Conda allows for efficient package management and helps resolve dependencies, making it easier to install and manage software packages, particularly in the scientific and bioinformatics domains.

### Running Abricate on Genomic Sequence File

```
abricate file_name_genomic.fna 
```
* ```abricate```: This is the command to execute the "abricate" tool. "abricate" is a bioinformatics tool used for analyzing genome assemblies and performing antibiotic resistance gene identification.

* ```file_name_genomic.fna```: This is the argument passed to the "abricate" command, specifying the input genomic sequence file in FASTA format that you want to analyze. Replace file_name_genomic.fna with the actual file name or path of your genomic sequence file.

By executing the command abricate file_name_genomic.fna, the "abricate" tool will read the specified genomic sequence file and perform its analysis, which typically involves identifying antibiotic resistance genes present in the genome.

Note that the specific functionalities and options of "abricate" may vary depending on the version and configuration of the tool installed on your system. 

### Running Abricate on Multiple Genomic Sequence Files and Generating a Summary Report

```
abricate -db resfinder *.fna > AMR_results.csv
abricate --summary AMR_results.csv > new_file_name_summary.csv
```
1- abricate: This is the command to execute the "abricate" tool.

* ```-db resfinder```: This option specifies the database to be used for analysis. In this case, the "resfinder" database is specified, which contains information about antibiotic resistance genes.

* ```.fna```: This is a wildcard that represents multiple genomic sequence files in FASTA format. The ```*.fna``` pattern matches all files with the .fna extension in the current directory.

* ```>```: This symbol is used for output redirection. It redirects the output of the command to a file instead of displaying it on the console.

AMR_results.csv: This is the file name specified after the redirection symbol (>). It represents the CSV file where the results of the "abricate" analysis will be saved. Replace AMR_results.csv with the desired file name or path.

By executing the command ```abricate -db resfinder *.fna > AMR_results.csv```, the "abricate" tool will analyze each of the genomic sequence files matching the ```*.fna``` pattern using the "resfinder" database. The results of the analysis, which typically include information about antibiotic resistance genes identified in the sequences, will be saved in the specified CSV file "AMR_results.csv".

Note that the specific options, databases, and output formats may vary depending on the version and configuration of the "abricate" tool. 


2- abricate: This is the command to execute the "abricate" tool.

* ```--summary```: This option specifies that a summary report should be generated.

* ```AMR_results.csv```: This is the input AMR results file in CSV format. It represents the file from which the summary report will be generated. Replace AMR_results.csv with the actual name or path of your existing AMR results file.

* ```>```: This symbol is used for output redirection. It redirects the output of the command to a file instead of displaying it on the console.

* ```new_file_name_summary.csv```: This is the file name specified after the redirection symbol (>). It represents the new file where the summary report will be saved. Replace new_file_name_summary.csv with the desired file name or path.

By executing the command abricate --summary AMR_results.csv > new_file_name_summary.csv, the "abricate" tool will read the AMR results file specified (AMR_results.csv) and generate a summary report based on the contents of the file. The summary report typically provides aggregated information about the antimicrobial resistance genes detected in the analyzed samples.

The resulting summary report will be saved in the specified file, "new_file_name_summary.csv". This new file will contain the summarized information derived from the original AMR results file.

Note that the specific options and formats may vary depending on the version and configuration of the "abricate" tool. 


# ABRICATE for virulence factor genes

### Running Abricate with VFDB Database in Quiet Mode on Genomic Sequence

```
abricate --db vfdb --quiet file_name_genomic.fna 
```
1- abricate: This is the command to execute the "abricate" tool.

* ```--db vfdb```: This option specifies the database to be used for analysis. In this case, the "vfdb" database is specified, which contains information about virulence factors.

* ```--quiet```: This option suppresses the progress and summary output of the "abricate" analysis. It means that the command will run silently without displaying any progress information or summary results during the analysis.

* ```file_name_genomic.fna```: This is the argument passed to the "abricate" command, specifying the input genomic sequence file in FASTA format that you want to analyze. Replace file_name_genomic.fna with the actual file name or path of your genomic sequence file.

By executing the command abricate --db vfdb --quiet file_name_genomic.fna, the "abricate" tool will read the specified genomic sequence file and perform its analysis using the "vfdb" database. It will identify and annotate the virulence factors present in the genomic sequences without displaying any progress information or summary results on the console.

Note that the specific functionalities, options, and databases available in "abricate" may vary depending on the version and configuration of the tool installed on your system.

It will identify and annotate the virulence factors present in the genomic sequences without displaying any progress information or summary results on the console.

The resulting analysis results, which typically include information about the detected virulence factors, will be saved in the specified CSV file "new_file_name.csv".

Note that the specific options, databases, and output formats may vary depending on the version and configuration of the "abricate" tool.
