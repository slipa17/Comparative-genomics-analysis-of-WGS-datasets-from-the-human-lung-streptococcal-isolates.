### Description of codes and scripts

1. **AMR_VFD_codes.md:** The code performs antibiotic resistance gene and virulence factor identification using ```abricate``` and saves both the detailed results and a summary of the analysis in separate CSV files.
2. **```split_headers_by_gap.sh:```** The provided bash script reads text files from a user-specified input folder, processes the files by removing everything after the first space in each line, and saves the processed files in a subfolder within the input directory named "processed." It then loops through each text file in the input directory and performs the processing operation.
