```python
genome_file='./genomic.gb'
gene_list_file='./gene_name_list.txt'
```


```python
from Bio import SeqIO
```


```python
with open(gene_list_file,'r') as input_file:
    gene_names=[line.strip('\n') for line in input_file]
```

* with open(gene_list_file, 'r') as input_file:: This line of code opens the file specified by the gene_list_file variable in read mode ('r'). The with statement is used to ensure proper handling of the file, automatically closing it after it is no longer needed. The file object is assigned to the variable input_file.

* gene_names = [line.strip('\n') for line in input_file]: This line of code creates a list called gene_names using a list comprehension. It iterates over each line in the input_file object and performs the following actions for each line:

* line.strip('\n'): The strip('\n') method is used to remove the newline character (\n) from the end of each line. This ensures that the resulting elements in the gene_names list do not contain trailing newline characters.
The modified line is then added as an element to the gene_names list.


```python
len(gene_names)
```
* gene_names: This is the list containing gene names that was previously created using the code snippet you provided.

* len(gene_names): This is the len() function applied to the gene_names list. The len() function is a built-in Python function that returns the number of elements in a list or the length of a string.

  By calling len(gene_names), you will get an integer value representing the number of gene names in the gene_names list. 


```python
gene_names[0:6]
```
* gene_names: This is the list that contains gene names, as mentioned earlier.

* [0:6]: This is called slicing notation in Python, and it is used to extract a portion of a list. In this case, 0 represents the starting index, and 6 represents the ending index (exclusive) of the sublist to be retrieved.

By executing gene_names[0:6], you will obtain a new list that includes the elements at indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 from the gene_names list. In other words, it retrieves the first six elements of the list. The original gene_names list remains unchanged.


```python
gb_object=SeqIO.read(genome_file,'gb')
```
* genome_file: This is the file path or file-like object representing the GenBank file from which you want to read the sequence record.

* SeqIO.read(): This is a function from Biopython's SeqIO module used for reading sequence records from a file. It takes two arguments:

* genome_file: The first argument specifies the file to read from, which is the GenBank file in this case.
'gb': The second argument is the format specifier, indicating that the file is in GenBank format. Biopython's SeqIO module supports various file formats, and 'gb' specifies the GenBank format in this case.

* gb_object: This is the variable that stores the sequence record read from the GenBank file. The SeqIO.read() function returns a single SeqRecord object representing the sequence record, and it is assigned to the gb_object variable.

After executing this code, you can access various properties and methods of the gb_object to extract information about the sequence, such as the sequence itself, annotations, features, or any other metadata associated with the sequence in the GenBank file.


```python
allgenes=[feature for feature in gb_object.features if feature.type =='gene']
```
* gb_object: This is the SeqRecord object representing the sequence record that was previously read from the GenBank file, as mentioned in the previous explanation.

* gb_object.features: This accesses the list of features associated with the GenBank sequence record. Features are regions or segments of the sequence that have specific annotations or characteristics. Examples of features include genes, exons, promoters, and other functional elements.

* [feature for feature in gb_object.features if feature.type =='gene']: This is a list comprehension, which allows you to create a new list by iterating over each feature in gb_object.features and filtering them based on a condition.

* feature for feature in gb_object.features: This part of the list comprehension specifies that each element in the new list will be a feature object (feature) taken from the gb_object.features list.

* if feature.type =='gene': This is the condition that filters the features. It checks if the feature type (feature.type) is equal to 'gene'. Only the features that satisfy this condition will be included in the new list.

By executing allgenes = [feature for feature in gb_object.features if feature.type =='gene'], you create a new list (allgenes) that contains only the features of type 'gene' from the GenBank sequence record. This allows you to specifically access and work with the gene features present in the sequence.


```python
len(allgenes)
```

```python
gene_sequences=[]
```
* gene_sequences: This is the variable name assigned to the empty list.

* []: The empty brackets represent an empty list literal. By assigning it to the variable gene_sequences, you create an empty list that can be used to store gene sequences or any other relevant information.

After executing this code, you have a list named gene_sequences that does not contain any elements. You can subsequently populate this list by adding gene sequences or any other desired data to it.

```python
for gene in allgenes:
    if 'gene' in gene.qualifiers.keys():
        gene_name=gene.qualifiers['gene'][0]
        if gene_name in gene_names:
            extract=gene.extract(gb_object)
            extract.id=gene_name
            extract.description=''
            gene_sequences.append(extract)
            print('gene %s has been found'%gene_name)
```
* for gene in allgenes:: This is a loop that iterates over each gene feature in the allgenes list. The variable gene represents an individual gene feature in each iteration of the loop.

* if 'gene' in gene.qualifiers.keys():: This condition checks if the 'gene' key exists in the qualifiers dictionary of the current gene feature. The qualifiers dictionary stores additional information or metadata associated with the gene feature.

* gene_name = gene.qualifiers['gene'][0]: This line of code retrieves the value associated with the 'gene' key from the qualifiers dictionary of the current gene feature and assigns it to the variable gene_name. It assumes that the value is a list, and [0] is used to access the first element of the list, which represents the gene name.

* if gene_name in gene_names:: This condition checks if the gene_name extracted from the current gene feature is present in the gene_names list. It verifies if the gene name is included in the list of gene names that were previously read from another file, as indicated by the variable gene_names.

* extract = gene.extract(gb_object): This line of code extracts the sequence associated with the current gene feature (gene) from the original GenBank sequence record (gb_object) and assigns it to the variable extract. The extract() method is used to obtain the sequence as a Seq object.

* extract.id = gene_name: This assigns the gene_name as the new ID of the extracted sequence (extract). It sets the identifier of the sequence to be the gene name.

* extract.description = '': This line of code sets the description of the extracted sequence (extract) to an empty string.

* gene_sequences.append(extract): This appends the extracted sequence (extract) to the gene_sequences list. It adds the sequence to the list of gene sequences.

* print('gene %s has been found' % gene_name): This line of code prints a message to the console indicating that a particular gene has been found. It uses string formatting (%s) to insert the value of gene_name into the printed message.

The loop iterates over the genes, checks if they have a 'gene' key in the qualifiers, matches their names with the gene_names list, extracts their sequences, assigns IDs, adds them to the gene_sequences list, and provides feedback on each found gene.


```python
len(gene_sequences)
```

```python
output_file='./gene_name.fasta'
```


```python
SeqIO.write(gene_sequences,output_file,'fasta')
```
* gene_sequences: This is the collection of gene sequences that you want to write to the output file. It is assumed to be a list of Seq objects or compatible sequence objects.

* output_file: This is the file path or file-like object representing the output file where you want to save the gene sequences in the FASTA format.

* 'fasta': This is the format specifier indicating that you want to write the sequences in the FASTA format. Biopython's SeqIO module supports various file formats, and 'fasta' specifies the FASTA format in this case.

By executing SeqIO.write(gene_sequences, output_file, 'fasta'), you are using the SeqIO.write() function to write the gene sequences to the specified output file in the FASTA format. The function automatically handles the formatting and structure required for the FASTA format, including sequence headers and sequence data.

After running this code, the gene sequences will be saved in the specified output file, following the FASTA format. The file can be subsequently used for further analysis or as input for other programs or tools that accept sequences in the FASTA format.
